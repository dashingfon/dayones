> ## Introduction

Dayones is an e-commerce platform that uses Blockchain technology to provide consumers with a secure, transparent, and reliable online shopping experience.

By acting as a tamper-proof middleman, Dayones ensures transactions are safe from fraud and manipulation, offering buyers and sellers a trustworthy environment free from interference or system abuse.


### Inspiration

The idea for this project came when I was trying to buy a router from a vendor on Twitter but wasn’t sure if I could trust him to deliver a quality product or even deliver it at all.

That experience got me thinking about how technology could solve this trust issue, and that’s how the project was born.


> ## Features

Feature 1: it enables Vendors to list products and pay for targeted ads.

Feature 2: it enables buyers to buy products.

Feature 3: it enables both buyers and sellers to track the product delivery lifecycle.

Feature 4: it enables people earn commisions for delivering products

> ## Challenges

One of the challenges we faced during this project was implementing the Haversine formula, as Solidity lacks support for many trigonometric functions.

We used the Haversine formula to automatically calculate delivery costs based on the distance between the buyer and seller. Despite the limitations, we successfully developed a functional version of the formula entirely on the blockchain.


> ## Future Improvements

The following areas are wher we plan to improve on in the future

1. Simplifying Conflict Resolution: Streamline and clarify the process for resolving disputes between buyers and sellers.
2. Using AI for Better Ad Targeting: Leverage AI to analyze buying patterns, recent activities, and more for improved ad targeting.
3. Comprehensive Product Delivery Tracking: Fully implement a map feature to track the entire product delivery lifecycle.
